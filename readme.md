- Run `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn dev` to start the dev server.

## Deploy

- The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

- We are using continous deployment so the `master` branch will be deployed on every commit. All pull requests are deployed as draft previews with a unique URL.
