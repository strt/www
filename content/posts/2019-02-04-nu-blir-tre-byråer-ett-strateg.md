In April, we became part of the Diplomat Group. Now it’s time for the next step. Gathering Strateg, branding experts YouMe Agency and design specialists Repeat Studio under a single brand – Strateg. With a total of 70 employees in Örebro and Stockholm, we’re one of Sweden’s largest creative communications agencies.

“With our collective experience of strategic thinking, creativity and digital innovation, we represent an unbeatable offering. We have the same name as before, but will be so much stronger,” says Fredrik Vannestål, CEO of Strateg.

Together, we help our clients with branding, digitalisation, the customer experience and sales. Moreover, in partnership with the other two companies in the Diplomat Group – Diplomat Communication and Tale – we can also offer outstanding services in public affairs, corporate communications, financial communications and content marketing.

We think this is all really great, so we celebrated our new form at our first joint after-hours get-together at our offices on Slöjdgatan in Örebro.
