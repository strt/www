## New name, new concept

In an industry where most things are changing, you need to refine and modernise your offering. And of course your communications. We were commissioned to develop a brand name and communications concept for Epiroc’s smart, connected machines and comprehensive system integration.

## Digitalisation a cause for concern

When it comes to automation, one of the biggest concerns in the industry is that humans will lose out. This makes it tricky to communicate the message of fewer people to those same people. At the same time, the competition are filling their marketing with driverless machines.

## 6th Sense – just like a shoal of fish

That’s why we did the opposite. Our concept film doesn’t feature a single machine. Just like fish have a sixth sense (yes, actually, they do) that allows them to keep track of one another when swimming in a shoal, the machines in Epiroc’s new concept can do the same when working side by side. The brand name? 6th Sense. And the concept? A film, among other things. Check it out!

## 150,00 views and counting

The film has been used internally and externally with great success. It’s racked up more than 150,000 views on Vimeo.

_“With market surveys, research and analysis, Strateg has come up with a concept that is both innovative and creative, unique in the industry and completely in line with our vision of effective, digitalised mining.”_
